# Getting started

Let's create a simple `deno` server and make it configurable by

- Creating a tenant, a container for the generated configuration state.
- Declaring a builder that accepts configs
- Exporting a couple of configurations for this builder
- Building a versioned service state from the configs
- Importing said state into our application to determine service behaviour
- Installing apps to manage service behaviour

## Creating a deno service

If you haven't done so, go and [install Deno](https://deno.land).

Our example deno service will be an `act-slogan-generator` which combines a set of words that start with the letters `a`, `c` and `t` to generate a three-word `act` slogan.
